"""
DBT run - builds all models in DAG models - staging to final dashboards
DBT -test - runs all the tests
Need to stop pipeline immediately if a test fails
DBT build - runs and tests models in logical sequence
    1st runs test on sources
    2nd rns on models - then goes to any tests on that models
    And continues
** Ensures that bad data never reaches the fact and dimension tables.

Therefore. DBT build is four runs:
    dbt run
    dbt test
    dbt seed (loads csv data into warehouse tables)
    dbt snapshot (tracks slowly changing dimensions in the dat)

Documentation - 
sources - add what the data is from and what it means
models - add what the model does
